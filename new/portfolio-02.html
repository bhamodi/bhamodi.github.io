            <h3>General Overview</h3>
            <p>This is a project that I am particularly proud of. I truly enjoyed this Android development project. It was a lot of work and I spent a lot of my free time developing this game. Inspired by Flappy Bird, I created a game called Nyan Bird which the market received very well. It has attained over 15,000 downloads and over 350,000 round plays as of now. I distributed my game internationally to all the major app stores. Unfortunately, there was a content policy issue with my game on the Google Play Store where I had a majority of my downloads alone. I was upset at the time it was taken down but I have now come to accept it and be grateful that I had the opportunity to gain so much Android and mobile development experience. The good news is that my game is still available on different markets. Furthermore, a recent update allows my game to work on the BlackBerry OS instead of just being an Android only game.</p>

            <h3>Software</h3>
            <p>I will briefly talk about the technical side of this project here. I used the ADT (Android Developer Tools) plug-in for Eclipse and coded my game in Java with some formatting in XML. I also used a nice cross-platform game framework called LibGDX. I learned a lot of important game development principles such as implementing the main game loop, game states, external API integration and maintaining a steady 30 FPS. I also learned about unique 2D game techniques such as parallax scrolling to create background/3D depth.</p>
