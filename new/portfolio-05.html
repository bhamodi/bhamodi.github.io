            In this project, I worked with three other Mechatronics Engineers to design, build and program an autonomous fuel cell powered car. I was actively involved in all stages and I assumed a leadership role in my team.<br><br>This fuel cell powered car featured a PID control system and was able to follow lines very accurately. This project really expanded my knowledge of embedded systems and low-level programming. We used a combination of C and C++ to interact with the MSP-430 Microcontroller.
