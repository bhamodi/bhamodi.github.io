            This project has saved me so many hours and allows me to keep a track of my finanaces. Balance Tracker has been such a useful application and I am in the process of open-sourcing this product so that more people can keep track of their finances. Essentially, this tool logs into all your online bank accounts and scrapes your total balances in each account. After it has completed going through all your accounts, it totals up the balance and it outputs the detailed information in a speadsheet. By the end of the year, this tool will have populated my spreadsheet with my total balance every single day. This is great for tracking finances and observing where and when you made money or spent money. The best part about this project is that I have set it up with Windows Task Scheduler so that my tool tuns itself every night at 11:00 PM. This makes this tool fully automatic and it runs in the background. Talk about convenient!<br><br>
            Actually, to add to the convenience of this tool, I integrated the Twilio API and now my tool texts me my total balance and how much it changed from yesterday daily! This is awesome because now I don't even need to be at my computer to check what my daily balance is or how much it went up or down from yesterday.<br>
            The core of this tool was developed using Python and Selenium. This project will be open sourced in the near future.
