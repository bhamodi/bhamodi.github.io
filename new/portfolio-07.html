        <div class="description">Gabriele Galimberti is a documentary/travel photographer whose work has appeared in many international magazines including Newsweek, Le Monde, Geo, La Repubblica, Io Donna and Vanity Fair among others.<br><br>
He  was born in Tuscany in 1977 and studied photography at ‘Fondazione Marangoni’ in Florence.  In 2002 Gabriele was selected as one of ten emerging young photographers in a competition called  ’Giovane Fotografia in Italia’.  He simultaneously made his debut as a commercial photographer with his first magazine assignments, and while he continues to be active in the field, his interests have expanded to include documentary/travel photography. In this vein he recently completed an 18-month couch-surfing trip around the world during which he gathered material for a number of photographic projects.</div>
