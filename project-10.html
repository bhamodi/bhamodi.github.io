      <h2>General Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This project was completed at Hack the North 2015 which was Canada's largest Hackathon. Over 4600 hackers applied and only 1000 got accepted. It was 36 hours of pure hacking with some of the brightest individuals in tech. My team and I set out to build the ultimate personal assistant app. The goal of this personal assistant was to integrate and provide the user with access to as many third-party APIs and services possible with a single voice command. This project was complex in nature as we also built out hardware integrations that would allow users to turn lights on/off, open/close blinds and control other appliances in their household. This project integrated many types of technologies ranging from smartwatches capturing voice commands, to the Android app parsing and sending voice commands to our LAMP stack backend server which also communicated to our Node server running on a microprocessor that handled hardware actuators.

      In addition to allowing users to send voice commands from their smartwatches and smartphones, we also built a website that can process voice commands. You can view that website <a href="http://auxiliator.co/web/" target="_blank">here.</a>

      <h2>Software</h2>
      <p>
        I was personally responsible for building the Android app. I learned a lot about native Android as well as the Google SpeechRecognizer API. I implemented a signin activity which checked that the user has correct credentials before allowing them to enter the application. Once the user was verified, the UI would allow the user to click a button and I would then start listening for their voice command. Upon completion of the voice command, I would parse it and figure out if it was something that I could process by within the application itself or whether I would need to send the command to the backend server for further processing. Actions that I could parse and complete directly within the app included calling a friend, texting a friend, opening another application and more. Commands that were related to hardware such as turning lights on or off, opening or closing blinds or other appliances were all sent to the backend server to be processed via POST requests.

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, we did not win the hackathon. However, we were still winners at the end of the day as we all learned so much over the 36 hours of hacking. We made many great connections and also built the MVP (minimum viable product). Hopefully one day after we polish a bit more, we'll be able to actually release it for the world to use.
