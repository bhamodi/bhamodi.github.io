										<p>During my time with IBM, I have accomplished and learned many great skills such as tool development, web automation, application/database scripting and dealing with big data in an efficient and secure manner. One of the data collection tools that I developed and shipped internally is currently saving IBM approximately $1000 annually per employee who uses it. I can further elaborate in an interview setting how this number is calculated.<br>Further accomplishments include my backup/restoration automation and data verification automation which have been delivered and are also being used internally. My automation made significant advances to IBM's initiatives in creating pipeline software to increase testing efficiency and hence produce a more continuous development environment.</p>

										<p>I worked with Onprint over the summer doing graphic design work using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. It was a very interesting position as I was working directly on graphic design that local companies and start-ups requested. My graphic design ranged from brochures to business cards to menus to window decals.</p>

										<p>Mechatronics Engineering has been exactly what I was hoping it would be so far. I am really interested in the integration of mechanical, electrical and software systems. University of Waterloo is offering us a lot of valuable knowledge in lectures, a lot of hands-on projects and labs and a wonderful co-op program to allow us to apply our knowledge in the workplace.</p>

										<p>High school was a very important time in my life as I developed my interest in robotics and software in grade 9. I developed my first game in grade 10. I learned Java in grade 11 and since then I have been continually improving and learning. During high school, I was a leader in the Programming, Robotics and Electric Car Clubs. Furthermore, I was the Assistant Captain of the Senior Boy's Soccer Team.</p>
