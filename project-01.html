      <h3>General Overview</h3>
      <p>I started this project towards the end of my 1A term after I had almost completed my Linear Algebra and Digital Computation courses. I combined my knowledge from both of these courses (the matrix operations from Linear Algebra and the C++ knowledge from Digital Computation) to make a very useful matrix calculator that helped me verify my homework answers. It was a nice challenge and real life application after learning so much C++ and algebra over the semester. You can find the C++ code on my <a href="https://github.com/bhamodi/Matrix-Calculator" target="_blank">GitHub.</a></p>
      <h3>Software</h3>
      <p>The algorithms I used are fairly straightforward and I derived them by myself from my knowledge in Linear Algebra. I still have some matrix functions/operations not coded because the algorithms are overly complex. Some of these complex functions include finding the inverse of a matrix and finding the determinant. I hope to one day establish an efficient algorithm to handle these operations.</p>
      <h3>Current Plans</h3>
      <p>Since I have gained some Android and mobile development experience from my other projects, I revisited this calculator and I am currently in the process of porting it to Android. This will allow me to release a Matrix Calculator application that will help many people around the world with their matrix calculations.</p>
