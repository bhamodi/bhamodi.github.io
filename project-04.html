      <h2>General Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This entire website is a result of this project. I found this project to be really fun as I was able to completely design every aspect of the website from the ground up, no restrictions. I took the required steps to make this website fully responsive so that it adjusts to any screen size. I made sure that my website has a nice UI & UX on both desktop and mobile. I also went through a lot of optimization stages to ensure that the content is easily accessible to users and that the website loads as fast as possible. I used Google's PageSpeed Insights to discover all the methods of speed and performance optimization.
